Main Success Scenario:
  1. Have a try final around the whole script
    try:
      all my code
    finally:
      my required to run code
  2. End 
Alternatives:
  1a. When an except block in a try except statement handles an error
    1a1. my required to run code
    1a2. Go to step 2
  1b. When an except block in a try except statement re-throws an error
    1b1. Run "my required to run code" in the except block before leaving it (which would exit the currently running code)
      try:
        my code
      except:
        my required to run code
        re-throw error 
    1b2. Go to step 2
