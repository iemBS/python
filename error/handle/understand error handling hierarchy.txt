Hierarchy
-try statement 
  -try clause
    -raise statement (w exception class)
  -except clause (w & wo exception class) (as exception instance)
    -raise statement (w & wo exception class) (from exception instance or none)
  -else clause
  -finally clause
  
  
  Definitions
  -else: Only executes if the tray clause throws no exception
  -except: Catches all errors if no exception class is specified. Catches on the error or a child of that when an exception class is specified.
  -finally: Always executes
  -raise: Within the try clause, raises a specific type of error. Within an except clasue, raises the same type of error or a new type of error. If the error type is a child type of that except clause it was caught by, the re-raise would be of the original error type.
