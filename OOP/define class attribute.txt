Define Class Attribute
Note:
  -Guidance @ 
    -https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/
  -Class attributes are attributes that have the same value for all class instances. 
  -You can define a class attribute by assigning a value to a variable name outside of .__init__().
  -Class attributes are defined directly beneath the first line of the class name and are indented by four spaces.
  -Class attributes must always be assigned an initial value. 
  -When an instance of the class is created, class attributes are automatically created and assigned to their initial values.
  -Use class attributes to define properties that should have the same value for every class instance. 
  -Use instance attributes for properties that vary from one instance to another.

Main Success Scenario:
  1. Define a class with a class attrbiute and two instance attributes
  
    class Dog:
        # Class attribute
        species = "Canis familiaris"

        # Instance attribute 
        def __init__(self, name, age):
            self.name = name
            self.age = age
