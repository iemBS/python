Define Instance Method
Note:
  -Guidance @ 
    -https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/
  -Instance methods are functions that are defined inside a class.
  -Instance methods can only be called from an instance of that class. 
  -Just like .__init__(), an instance methodâ€™s first parameter is always self.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. enter "py" on the cmd line to start the Python launcher
  2. Define class (leave last line blank so that command line will see it as the end of the class)
    class Dog:
        # Class attribute
        species = "Canis familiaris"

        # instance attributes 
        def __init__(self, name, age):
            self.name = name
            self.age = age

        # Instance method
        def description(self):
            return f"{self.name} is {self.age} years old"

        # Another instance method
        def speak(self, sound):
            return f"{self.name} says {sound}"
