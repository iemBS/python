Define Class Method
Note:
  -Guidance @ 
    -https://realpython.com/instance-class-and-static-methods-demystified/
  -Class method does not use instance attributes, but it can use class attributes. 
  -Class method cannot change object state, but it can change class state
  -Explanation of "cls" in class methods @ https://realpython.com/instance-class-and-static-methods-demystified/
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See code below
    class MyClass:
        def method(self):
            return 'instance method called', self

        @classmethod
        def classmethod(cls):
            return 'class method called', cls

        @staticmethod
        def staticmethod():
            return 'static method called'
