Main Success Scenario:
  1. enter "py" on the cmd line to start the Python launcher
  2. Define class (leave last line blank so that command line will see it as the end of the class)
    class Dog:
        # Class attribute
        species = "Canis familiaris"

        # instance attributes 
        def __init__(self, name, age):
            self.name = name
            self.age = age

        # Instance method
        def description(self):
            return f"{self.name} is {self.age} years old"

        # Another instance method
        def speak(self, sound):
            return f"{self.name} says {sound}"
  3. Get an instance of the Dog object
    miles = Dog("Miles", 4)
  4. Call 1st instance method
    miles.description()
  5. See "'Miles is 4 years old'"
  6. Call 2nd instance method
    miles.speak("Woof Woof")
  7. See "'Miles says Woof Woof'"
Alternatives:
  4a. Call an instance method that is in the same class as the instance method it is called from
    4a1. prefix method being called with "self."
    4a2. Go to step 5
  4b. Call an instance method from the main method in the same class
    xxx:fill in
  4c. Call an instance method that is in a class and the class is in the same module as the call
    xxx:fill in
