Main Success Scenario:
  1. enter "py" on the cmd line to start the Python launcher
  2. Define class (leave last line blank so that command line will see it as the end of the class)
    class Dog:
        # Class attribute
        species = "Canis familiaris"

        # instance attributes 
        def __init__(self, name, age):
            self.name = name
            self.age = age

        # Instance method
        def description(self):
            return f"{self.name} is {self.age} years old"

        # Another instance method
        def speak(self, sound):
            return f"{self.name} says {sound}"
  3. Get an instance of the Dog object
    miles = Dog("Miles", 4)
  4. Call 1st instance method
    miles.description()
  5. See "'Miles is 4 years old'"
  6. Call 2nd instance method
    miles.speak("Woof Woof")
  7. See "'Miles says Woof Woof'"
