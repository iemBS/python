Define Class
Note:
  -More than one class can exist in a .py file
  -A .py file can have at most one module
  -Guidance @

  -The body of the Dog class consists of a single statement: the pass keyword. pass is often used as a placeholder indicating where code will eventually go. It allows you to run this code without Python throwing an error.
  -Custom objects are mutable by default. An object is mutable if it can be altered dynamically. For example, lists and dictionaries are mutable, but strings and tuples are immutable.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Define class and save it in the Dog.py file
      class Dog:
          pass
  2. Choose Name that fits the functionality
  3. "Format Class Name"

  
Format Class Name

Main Success Scenario:
  1. Use PascalCase
Alternatives:
  1a. The interface is documented and used primarily as a callable
    1a1. The naming convention for functions may be used instead in cases where .
  1b. for builtin names
    1b1. Most builtin names are single words (or two words run together), with the CapWords convention used only for exception names and builtin constants.
