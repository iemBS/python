Instantiate an Object
Note:
  -Guidance @ https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/
  -You can instantiate a new object by typing the name of the class, followed by opening and closing parentheses.
  -Instantiating and object and letting the value go to the screen, will show the memory address.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. write "py" on cmd line and hit enter
  2. see ">>>" prompt
  3. Create simple class (last line after "pass" is empty and has no indent to indicate end of class and get ">>>" prompt to show again)
    class Dog:
      pass
    
  4. see ">>>" prompt
  5. write "Dog()" on cmd line and hit enter
  6. see "<__main__.Dog object at 0x00000205133701D0>"
  7. see ">>>" prompt
  8. write "Dog()" on cmd line and hit enter
  9. see a different memory address
