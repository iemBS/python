Define Instance Attribute
Note:
  -Guidance @ 
    -https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/
  -Attributes created in .__init__() are called instance attributes.
  -An instance attributeâ€™s value is specific to a particular instance of the class.
  -If the class is named "Dog" and there are "name" and "age" instance attributes, all Dog objects have a name and an age, but the values for the name and age attributes will vary depending on the Dog instance.
  -
Main Success Scenario:
  1.Define Dog class with two instance attributes 
  
    class Dog:
        def __init__(self, name, age):
            self.name = name
            self.age = age
