# The e stands for Exponent, which means the number of tens you multiply a number by. For example, if I square 123456789, I get 1.524157875019e+16, which means that the answer is 1.524157875019 times 10 raised to the sixteenth power (that is, multiplied by 10 sixteen times)

x = 35e3
y = 12E4
z = -87.7e100

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
