Test if a Python Program can run
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Create an empty file called "hello.py"
  2. Save the following code in that file
    #! python
    import sys
    sys.stdout.write("hello from Python %s\n" % (sys.version,))
  3. Open a command prompt and navigate to the folder for that file
  4. Type the following in the command prompt and press enter
      py hello.py
  5. Your version of Python that is installed will be returned to the UI
Alternatives:
  2a. Run your Python code as a specific version
    2a1. Run your code under the Python 3.6 version
      #! python3.6
      import sys
      sys.stdout.write("hello from Python %s\n" % (sys.version,))
    2a2. Go to step 3.
