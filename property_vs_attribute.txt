# Property
- Properties are a special kind of attribute.
- Good explanation of a property
    When Python encounters the following code it looks up eggs in spam. Then, 
    it examines eggs to see if it has a __get__, __set__, or __delete__ methods. 
    If it does, it's a property. 

      spam = SomeObject()
      print(spam.eggs)

    If it is a property, instead of just returning the eggs object (as it would for any other attribute) it will call the 
    __get__ method (since we were doing lookup) and return whatever that method returns. 

# Attribute
- not what is above
