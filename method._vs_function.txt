# method
- Python method is called on an object
- Since we call a method on an object, it can access the data within it. A method may alter an object's state.
- Methods are associated to a class and a class instance (aka object). 

# function
- Python function usually only operates on an object, and then prints something or returns a value.
- Functions are not associated to a class or class instance (aka object).
